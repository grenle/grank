#+TITLE: Grank

A mode aware URL yanking facility. See the [[./src][README]] in the src
folder for more information.

* Install

Clone this repository somewhere (on GNU/Linux I use
=~/elisp/=)

In your =.emacs= file simply add the path and require,
replacing the path to where you cloned this repo:

#+begin_src elisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "~/elisp/grank")
(require 'grank)
#+end_src

* Use

After copying a URL from somewhere, =M-x= and call =grank=.

* Config

For ease of use, add a shortcut. I use =C-c y= as it's close
to yank.

#+begin_src elisp
(global-set-key (kbd "C-c y") 'grank)
#+end_src
